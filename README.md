# lox

This is a work-in-progress Rust implementation of the _lox_ language from 
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

*   **Why implement lox?** Because I want to learn more about how interpreters
    work

*   **Why in Rust?** The first part of the book uses Java, but for me,
    translating this language (which I don't know) into another language which
    I'm more interested in learning is more appealing
